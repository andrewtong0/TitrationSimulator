# Titration Simulator
A silly game about doing titrations as fast and as accurately as possible. I made this because I thought it would be funny. Now I question my sanity.

**You can play the game in your browser** [here](https://andrewtong.me/TitrationSimulatorWebApp/).

### Goal and How to Play:
The goal is to perform a titration as afast and as accurately as possible. You can dispense liquid from the burette by clicking and holding the mouse. Once the soludtion begins turning pink from the phenolphthalein, you are getting close to finding the molarity. Once the solution settles and sits at a light pink, submit the lab report!
